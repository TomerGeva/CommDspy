### Generating OSR1 and OSR `n` signal
```python
import CommDspy as cdsp
import numpy as np
def tx_example():
    # ==================================================================================================================
    # Local variables
    # ==================================================================================================================
    prbs_type       = cdsp.constants.PrbsEnum.PRBS13
    bits_per_symbol = 2
    bit_order_inv   = False
    inv_msb         = False
    inv_lsb         = False
    pn_inv          = False
    constellation   = cdsp.constants.ConstellationEnum.PAM4
    full_scale      = True
    gray_coding     = False 
    poly_coeff      = cdsp.get_polynomial(prbs_type)
    init_seed       = np.array([1] * prbs_type.value)
    prbs_len        = 25  # can be any number

    # Getting PRBS binary pattern
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    prbs_seq, seed_dut = cdsp.tx.prbs_gen(poly_coeff, init_seed, prbs_len * bits_per_symbol)
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Duplicating if needed and coding
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    pattern       = cdsp.tx.bin2symbol(prbs_seq, 2 ** bits_per_symbol, bit_order_inv, inv_msb, inv_lsb, pn_inv)
    pattern       = cdsp.tx.mapping(pattern, constellation, full_scale) if not gray_coding else cdsp.tx.mapping(cdsp.tx.coding_gray(pattern, constellation), constellation, full_scale)

    return pattern
    
pattern = tx_example()
# ==================================================================================================================
# Pulse shaping
# ==================================================================================================================
rolloff     = 0.5
tx_out_rect = cdsp.channel.pulse_shape(pattern,osr=32, span=8, method='rect')
tx_out_sinc = cdsp.channel.pulse_shape(pattern,osr=32, span=8, method='sinc')
tx_out_rcos = cdsp.channel.pulse_shape(pattern,osr=32, span=8, method='rcos', beta=rolloff)
tx_out_rrc  = cdsp.channel.pulse_shape(pattern,osr=32, span=8, method='rrc', beta=rolloff)
```
Results:

**Figure 1** - Simple Tx example

The pulse shaped signal can be plotted as an eye diagram as follows:
```python
eye_d, amp_vec = cdsp.eye_diagram(tx_out_rcos, 32, 128, fs_value=3, quantization=2048, logscale=True)
```
The results can be seen using `matplotlib.pyplot` functions such as `contourf`:

## Passing a signal through channels
The package can be used to pass a signal through different channels
### AWGN
Adding white gaussian noise on top of the pulse shaping, this is done by:
```python
rolloff = 0.9
snr     = 30
pattern = tx_example()
ch_out  = cdsp.channel.awgn(pattern, osr=32, span=8, method='rcos', beta=rolloff, snr=snr)
eye_d, amp_vec = cdsp.eye_diagram(ch_out, 32, 128, fs_value=3, quantization=2048, logscale=False)
time_ui = np.linspace(0, 2, 256)
```
The result can be shown in the form of an eye diagram:

![awgn_snr30](./pictures/eye_rcos_awgn_snr30.png)

**Figure 3** AWGN eye diagran, rolloff 0.9 and SNR 30 [dB]

![awgn_snr10](./pictures/eye_rcos_awgn_snr10.png)

**Figure 4** AWGN eye diagran, rolloff 0.9 and SNR 10 [dB]

### ISI + AWGN channel
The ISI is given via filter parameters `a` and `b` where `b` are FIR parameters and `a` are IIR parameters.
```python
rolloff = 0.9
snr = 10
b = [0.7]
a = [1, -0.2]
pattern = tx_example()
ch_out = cdsp.channel.awgn_channel(pattern, b, a, osr=32, span=8, method='rcos', beta=rolloff, snr=snr)
eye_d, amp_vec = cdsp.eye_diagram(ch_out, 32, 128, fs_value=3, quantization=1024, logscale=False)
```
The result can be shown in the form of an eye diagram:

## Simple receiver model
The package supports simple concepts of digital processing receiver models. Example for such a receiver is given in the following:
1. Generating PRBS13 pattern
2. Loading the sampled channel from the above example
3. Passing the signal through the ISI chaneel + adding noise as seen in the previous examples
4. Defining Continuous  Time Linear Equalizer (CTLE) via zeros, poles and DC gain
5. passing channel output through the CTLE
6. Computing Rx Feed Forward Equalizer (FFE) and Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE)
7. Passing CTLE output through Rx FFE and DFE

**Figure 6** Channel output with SNR of 30 [dB], heavy ISI

![ch_out_snr10](./pictures/eye_ch_out_rx_example_snr10.png)

**Figure 6** Channel output with SNR of 10 [dB], heavy ISI

For the example above, the resulted CTLE is:

![CTLE_example](./pictures/CTLE_example.png)

**Figure 8** CTLE example

And the eye diagram after the CTLE is: 

![CTLE_out](./pictures/eye_ctle_out_rx_example_snr30.png)

**Figure 9** Eye diagram at the CTLE output

We can see that there is heavy ISI that can not be easily overcome by a CTLE alone, therefore we will use the Rx FFE. The resulting eye diagram after finding the Rx FFE:

![ffe_out30](./pictures/eye_ffe_out_rx_example_snr30.png)

**Figure 10** Eye diagram, FFE output with SNR of 30 [dB]

![ffe_out30](./pictures/eye_slicer_in_example_snr10.png)

**Figure 11** Eye diagram, Slicer in (after FFE and 1 tap DFE) with SNR of 10 [dB]

And we can see that the ISI was negated by the CTLE and FFE and DFE.

## Geinie error checker
The package allows locking a PRBS data on the true PRBS and use that to check for errors. Example of such usage will be as follows:
1. passing the Rx FFE result through a slicer
2. decoding the symbols
3. converting the symbols bacl to binary
4. checking for errors
```python
# ==================================================================================================================
# Local variables
# ==================================================================================================================
prbs_type       = cdsp.constants.PrbsEnum.PRBS13
constellation   = cdsp.constants.ConstellationEnum.PAM4
gray_coding     = False
full_scale      = True
rx_ffe_out      = rx_example()
bits_per_symbol = 2
bit_order_inv   = False
inv_msb         = False
inv_lsb         = False
pn_inv          = False
# ==================================================================================================================
# Slicing Rx FFE out to constellation points
# ==================================================================================================================
slicer_out = cdsp.rx.slicer(rx_ffe_out, levels=cdsp.get_levels(constellation, full_scale))
# ==================================================================================================================
# Decoding
# ==================================================================================================================
decoded_dut = cdsp.rx.demapping(slicer_out, constellation) if not gray_coding else cdsp.rx.decoding_gray(cdsp.rx.demapping(slicer_out, constellation), constellation)
# ==================================================================================================================
# Converting to binary
# ==================================================================================================================
bit_vec_dut = cdsp.rx.symbol2bin(decoded_dut, 2 ** bits_per_symbol, bit_order_inv, inv_msb, inv_lsb, pn_inv)
# ==================================================================================================================
# Checking for errors
# ==================================================================================================================
lost_lock, correct_bit_count, error_bit = cdsp.rx.prbs_checker(prbs_type, bit_vec_dut, init_lock=False)
print(f'Lost lock: {lost_lock}')
print(f'Correct bit count: {correct_bit_count}')
print(f'Erred bits: {sum(error_bit)}')
```
And for the example above with very low noise we getzero errors since the eye is wide open, ever for SNR of 10 dB.
```python
# Lost lock: False
# Correct bit count: 16294
# Erred bits: 0
```
When Running the code for SNR of 0 [dB] we get:
```python
# Lost lock: False
# Correct bit count: 16272
# Erred bits: 22
```
And due to the high noise, the eye closed enough to generate 22 errored bits from the entire pattern we passed through the channel 

# Functions' Description

### 0.1. get_polynomial
Function receives the PRBS type enumeration (detailed below) and returns the commonly used generating polymonial coefficients for the PRBS pattern
### 0.2. get_levels
Function receives the constellation enumeration (detailed below) and returns the levels in the constellation. The function containg a "full_scale" flag. In case this flag is True, the levels are scaled such that random data which is coded to this constellation will have mean power of 1 (0 [dB])
### 0.3. power
Function receives a signal, returns the mean power of the signal
### 0.4. rms
Function receives a signal, returns the RMS of the signal
### 0.5. buffer
Function receives a signal and breaks is into overlapping parts. Function is inputted with:
* signal - Input numpy array vector to be buffered
* length - The length of the chunks to be returned, should be a non-zero integer
* overlap=0 - The number of overlapping symbols in the signal between each rows. Default is 0, i.e. no overlap. for values larger than 0, there will be overlap and for values smaller than 0 the following row will skip the respective number of symbols
* delay=0 - The number of zero padding to perform over the beginning of the signal
* clip=False - If False, padding the end of the signal with zeros such that the last row will have "length" length. If True, clips the data to match the length "length"
